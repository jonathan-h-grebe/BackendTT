# NasaFuel

This project contains a solution to Back Test Task, by Jonathan Hill on March 17th 2022.

The solution is implemented as the following function:
  NasaFuelCalculator.calculate_fuel_for_mission/2

The code is intended to be self-documenting, so comments are kept to a minimum.

Unit tests have also been defined in the NasaFuelCalculatorTest module,
including the 3 examples provided in the Backend TT document.
